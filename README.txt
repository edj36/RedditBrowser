-‘Reddit’ is a simple iOS application that parses JSON from www.reddit.com and displays it to the user 
-The user can filter which subreddit they want to view or opt to see the Front Page 
-Within the chosen subreddit, users can filter the content they want to see (‘hot’, ‘new’, or ‘controversial’)
-Posts in each subreddit are clickable, and lead to a detail view of the individual post
-Each cell for the subreddit contains data regarding the post, including author, number of comments and score 
-Reddit is coded in Swift 1.2 and built for use on iOS 8.4 
-There are no third party frameworks used, mainly so it will hopefully be easier to update to Swift 2 in the future
-The subreddit tableview has functional pull-down to refresh for users to get new data
